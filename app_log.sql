-- General purpose logging components.
-- The core is an object oriented user defined type with logging methods.
--
-- Since the autonomous transactions write independently, you can get status
-- of the program before "succesful" completion that might be required for dbms_output.
-- For long running processes that means you can "tail" the log (select * from app_log_tail_v)
-- to watch what is happening. It also means that if the thing blows up or is hung,
-- and does not display the dbms_output for you, you can still go see it in the log table.
--
-- Since the messages include a high precision timestamp, you can see from the time between
-- log messages the elapsed time for operations. Mining the log for this information is fun.
-- The view app_log_tail_v shows you how to use an analytic to calculate that elapsed time.
--
-- In addition to generally useful logging, it is indispensable for debugging and development.

-- Reading the table is a person doing research. They can afford full table scans.

-- We use two tables with a synonym to facilitate purging without interruption. You will never
-- use these two table names directly, but instead the synonym "APP_LOG" if you are in the same schema
-- (or if you create a public synonym), or the view APP_LOG_BASE_V which uses the local synonym.

CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE app_log_udt AS OBJECT (
/* 
    Purpose: Provide general purpose logging capability for PL/SQL applications

    Tables: app_log_app     -- small automatically populated lookup table app_name/app_id pairs
            app_log         -- all log records by app_id (actually a synonym to one of 2 base tables)
    Views: app_log_base_v   -- uses the synonym to pick the base table
           app_log_v        -- joins on app_id to provide a view that includes the app_name string
           app_log_tail_v   -- last 20 records of log joined on app_id with elapsed time from prior record

    Type: app_log_udt       -- an object type with constructor and methods for performing simple logging

    Example of using this object:

        DECLARE
            -- instantiate an object instance for app_name 'bnft' which will automatically
            -- create the app_log_app entry if it does not exist
            v_log_obj   app_log_udt := app_log_udt('bnft');
        BEGIN
            -- log a message for our app
            v_log_obj.log('whatever my message: '||sqlerrm);
            -- same but also do DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE with the message too
            v_log_obj.log_p('whatever my message: '||sqlerrm);
        END;

    Example of an exception block:

        Assumes the following declarations in the program:
            g_sqlerrm                       VARCHAR2(512);
            g_backtrace                     VARCHAR2(32767);
            g_callstack                     VARCHAR2(32767); 
            g_log       app_log_udt := app_log_udt('my application name string');
        ...
        EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
            g_sqlerrm := SQLERRM;
            g_backtrace := DBMS_UTILITY.FORMAT_ERROR_BACKTRACE;
            g_callstack := DBMS_UTILITY.FORMAT_CALL_STACK;
            g_log.log_p('sqlerrm    : '||g_sqlerrm);
            g_log.log_p('backtrace  : '||g_backtrace);
            g_log.log_p('callstack  : '||g_callstack);
            RAISE;

    Example of calling the static logging of a message without declaring/initializing 
    an instance of the object. Not efficient, but ok for exception blocks
        app_log_udt.log('my app string', 'some message');
        app_log_udt.log_p('my app string', 'some message');
